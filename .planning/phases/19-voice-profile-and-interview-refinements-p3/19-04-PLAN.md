<task type="auto">
  <name>Add platform selection question</name>
  <files>src/voice/interview.ts</files>
  <action>
    Add platform selection question to interview:

    1. Create new PLATFORM_QUESTIONS array at top level
    2. Add "platform_select" question to list platforms user wants to configure
    3. Use multi-choice type for selecting multiple platforms
    4. Include X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok options

    Question structure:
    ```typescript
    const PLATFORM_SELECT_QUESTION: InterviewQuestion = {
      id: "platform_select",
      phase: "platforms",
      text: "Which platforms do you want to post on?",
      hint: "You can add more platforms later via /psn:voice edit",
      type: "multi-choice",
      required: true,
      options: ["X (Twitter)", "LinkedIn", "Instagram", "TikTok"]
    };
    ```

    Add to PLATFORM_QUESTIONS array:
    ```typescript
    const PLATFORM_QUESTIONS: InterviewQuestion[] = [
      PLATFORM_SELECT_QUESTION,
      // Platform-specific questions added in next task
    ];
    ```

    This determines which follow-up platform persona questions to show.

    Follow existing question pattern (IDENTY_QUESTIONS, STYLE_QUESTIONS).
