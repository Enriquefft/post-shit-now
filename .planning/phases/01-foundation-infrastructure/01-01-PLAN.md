<objective>
Fix database migration RLS policy error by creating hub_user role before schema migration. This resolves C2 (RLS policy error) and C3 (provider keys table missing), enabling database setup to complete successfully on Neon.

Purpose: The schema defines `pgRole("hub_user").existing()` but role doesn't exist in Neon, causing migration failures. By creating the role in a pre-migration step, RLS policies can be applied correctly.

Output: Migration file 0000_setup_rls_role.sql that creates hub_user role, updated meta journal, successful migration execution.

  <name>Create RLS role migration file (0000_setup_rls_role.sql)</name>
  <files>drizzle/migrations/0000_setup_rls_role.sql</files>
  <action>
Create drizzle/migrations/0000_setup_rls_role.sql with SQL to create hub_user role and grant permissions:

```sql
-- Create hub_user role for RLS policies
-- This must run BEFORE schema migration (0001_*.sql) which references hub_user

DO $$
BEGIN
  -- Check if role exists to avoid duplicate error
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'hub_user'
  ) THEN
    -- Create role
    CREATE ROLE hub_user;

    -- Grant schema usage
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO hub_user;

    -- Grant permissions on all existing tables
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO hub_user;

    -- Grant permissions on all existing sequences
    GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO hub_user;

    -- Ensure future tables inherit permissions
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
      GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO hub_user;

    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
      GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO hub_user;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Created hub_user role with appropriate permissions';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'hub_user role already exists';
  END IF;
END $$;
```

This follows CONTEXT.md decision: "Apply RLS to all tables or fail entirely" and research pattern for role creation before schema migration.

Run: `head -50 drizzle/migrations/0000_setup_rls_role.sql` to verify file exists and contains role creation SQL.

File drizzle/migrations/0000_setup_rls_role.sql exists with SQL that creates hub_user role and grants permissions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update Drizzle meta journal for new migration</name>
  <files>drizzle/meta/_journal.json</files>
  <action>
Read drizzle/meta/_journal.json to understand current migration structure. Add entry for 0000_setup_rls_role.sql to migrations array with appropriate timestamp and version. Ensure journal reflects correct order (0000 before 0001).

If _journal.json doesn't exist or is malformed, create a minimal valid structure:
```json
{
  "version": "7",
  "dialect": "postgresql",
  "entries": [
    {
      "idx": 0,
      "version": "0000_setup_rls_role",
      "when": 1737393600000,
      "tag": "0000_setup_rls_role",
      "breakpoints": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Then ensure existing 0001_schema migration has idx: 1, and increment all subsequent migration indices by 1.
</action>
  <verify>
Run: `cat drizzle/meta/_journal.json | jq .` to verify JSON is valid and 0000_setup_rls_role is first entry.
</verify>
  <done>
drizzle/meta/_journal.json is valid JSON with 0000_setup_rls_role as first migration entry.
</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Verify migration files exist and are ordered</name>
  <files>drizzle/migrations/</files>
  <action>
Verify that all necessary migration files exist in the correct order:
1. 0000_setup_rls_role.sql (created by this plan)
2. 0001_schema.sql (existing schema with RLS policies)
3. Any subsequent migrations

Run `ls -1 drizzle/migrations/*.sql | sort` to confirm ordering.

No code changes needed - migration runner already handles sequential execution. This task is verification-only to ensure migration files are properly structured.
</action>
  <verify>
Run: `ls -1 drizzle/migrations/*.sql | sort` to confirm 0000_setup_rls_role.sql exists and is first in list.
</verify>
  <done>
Migration files exist in correct order (0000, 0001, etc.), ready for execution by setup-db.ts.
</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing all tasks, verify:
1. drizzle/migrations/0000_setup_rls_role.sql exists and creates hub_user role
2. drizzle/meta/_journal.json has 0000_setup_rls_role as first migration
3. Migration files are in correct order (0000, 0001, etc.)
4. Setup-db.ts will execute migrations sequentially via runMigrations()
5. No changes needed to schema.ts - RLS policies can now reference existing role
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- hub_user role is created in migration before schema migration
- Migration journal reflects correct ordering (0000 before 0001)
- Database migrations complete without "role 'hub_user' does not exist" error
- api_keys table and all other tables are created successfully
- Setup wizard database step completes on Neon
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-infrastructure/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
