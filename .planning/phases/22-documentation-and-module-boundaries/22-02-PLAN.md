<objective>
Replace the existing `@psn/*` wildcard alias in `tsconfig.json` with three specific path alias pairs: `@psn/core`, `@psn/platforms`, and `@psn/trigger`.

Purpose: Specific aliases give Claude agents and IDE autocomplete module-scoped import suggestions. The wildcard alias has zero usages in source (confirmed by research), so replacement is safe.

Output: Updated `tsconfig.json` with five path alias entries (three bare aliases and two wildcard forms; no bare `@psn/trigger` since no barrel exists yet).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Replace wildcard alias with specific path aliases</name>
  <files>tsconfig.json</files>
  <action>
Read the current `tsconfig.json` at `/home/hybridz/Projects/post-shit-now/tsconfig.json`. Replace the existing `"@psn/*": ["./src/*"]` entry in the `paths` field with these five entries:

```json
"paths": {
  "@psn/core":        ["./src/core/index.ts"],
  "@psn/core/*":      ["./src/core/*"],
  "@psn/platforms":   ["./src/platforms/index.ts"],
  "@psn/platforms/*": ["./src/platforms/*"],
  "@psn/trigger/*":   ["./src/trigger/*"]
}
```

Rules:
- `@psn/core` (bare) maps to `./src/core/index.ts` — the top-level barrel (created in Plan 22-03)
- `@psn/core/*` maps to `./src/core/*` — deep imports like `@psn/core/types/publisher`
- `@psn/platforms` (bare) maps to `./src/platforms/index.ts` — the top-level barrel (created in Plan 22-03)
- `@psn/platforms/*` maps to `./src/platforms/*` — deep imports like `@psn/platforms/handlers/x.handler`
- `@psn/trigger/*` maps to `./src/trigger/*` — deep imports like `@psn/trigger/publish-post`
- Do NOT add bare `@psn/trigger` — `src/trigger/index.ts` does not exist and is out of scope for this phase; without the barrel the bare alias would fail to resolve
- Keep `"baseUrl": "."` unchanged
- Keep all other compilerOptions unchanged

Do NOT add tsconfig changes to trigger.config.ts or bunfig.toml — Bun reads tsconfig.json natively.

Do NOT update existing source files to use the new aliases — aliases are preferred style by convention only, not mandatory. Existing relative imports stay as-is.

After updating, run `bun run typecheck` to verify no regressions.
