<objective>
Build the weekly planning engine: calendar state visualization, trend-informed ideation mixed with idea bank, series-first slot allocation with pillar/archetype balancing, per-slot language suggestions, content remixing/recycling, and the /psn:plan multi-phase slash command. Also wire bilingual support into /psn:post (language selection step + "both" two-pass generation) and surface due series episodes in /psn:post's topic-gathering step. Finally, wire series state advancement into the publish path so publishing a series post advances episodeCount and lastPublishedAt.

Purpose: This is the capstone of Phase 5 -- the planning command that ties intelligence, ideas, series, and content generation into a coherent weekly workflow. Users go from zero to a fully planned and partially drafted week in one session. The /psn:post updates ensure bilingual and series features work outside the planning context too. The series state wiring ensures getDueEpisodes and getNextEpisodeLabel always reflect real publish history.
Output: Complete src/planning/ directory, plan CLI, /psn:plan slash command, updated /psn:post and generate.ts for bilingual + series wiring, updated publish-post.ts to advance series state.

**src/planning/types.ts:**
- `PlanSlotStatus` type: "outlined" | "drafted" | "approved" | "scheduled" | "published" | "skipped"
- `PlanSlot` interface: { day: string (ISO), platform: string, topic: string, format: string, pillar: string, language: string, seriesId?: string, seriesEpisode?: string, ideaId?: string, postId?: string, status: PlanSlotStatus }
- `WeeklyPlan` interface matching DB schema
- `CalendarState` interface: { weekStart, weekEnd, scheduledPosts: existing posts, seriesDue: due episodes, gaps: empty days, totalCapacity: number (from strategy.yaml frequency config) }
- `PlanIdea` interface: { topic, pillar, angle, format, source: "trend" | "bank" | "generated" | "remix" | "recycle", sourceId?, language? }
- `PlanPhase` type: "calendar" | "ideation" | "slotting" | "drafting" | "scheduling"

**src/planning/calendar.ts** - `getCalendarState(db, userId, weekStart: Date)`:
- Calculate weekEnd from weekStart + 7 days
- Query posts table for scheduled/published posts within the date range (PLAN-02)
- Query due series episodes via getDueEpisodes (SERIES-03)
- Load strategy.yaml for per-platform posting frequency to compute total weekly capacity (e.g., x: 7/week, linkedin: 3/week = 10 total slots)
- Identify gap days where no content is scheduled
- Return CalendarState

**src/planning/ideation.ts** - `generatePlanIdeas(db, userId, pillars, opts)`:
- PLAN-03: Check stored trend data from trends table (last 7 days, overallScore > 30)
- PLAN-03: Check idea bank for ready ideas via getReadyIdeas
- PLAN-03: If on-demand search keys are available, fire searchAll for each pillar to supplement
- PLAN-03: Review analytics -- load preference model for top formats, fatigued topics
- PLAN-04: Generate 10-15 PlanIdea objects mixing: trending topics with angles, ready ideas from bank, and newly generated topics using the existing suggestTopics from topic-suggest.ts
- Mix ratio: ~30% trend-based, ~30% from idea bank, ~20% generated, ~10% remix, ~10% recycle
- Each idea tagged with its source for transparency
- Filter out fatigued topics using isTopicFatigued from analytics/fatigue.ts
- Return PlanIdea[]

**src/planning/slotting.ts** - `allocateSlots(calendarState, ideas, series, options)`:
- PLAN-06: Auto-slot series episodes first -- lock due series into their platform's next available day
- PLAN-09: Distribute remaining slots across pillars weighted by strategy.yaml pillar weights. Use round-robin weighted selection.
- PLAN-10: Archetype/angle balancing -- track angles used in the week, prefer unused angles. Use the ANGLES list from topic-suggest.ts as the archetype taxonomy. No more than 2 of the same angle per week.
- Fill remaining gaps with ideas sorted by score/relevance
- Return PlanSlot[] for the full week

**src/planning/language.ts** - `suggestLanguages(slots: PlanSlot[], strategyConfig, recentPosts)`:
- PLAN-07: For each slot, suggest a language based on:
  - Strategy.yaml language config (primary/secondary language, default)
  - Recent language mix (query last 14 days of posts for language distribution)
  - Platform conventions (e.g., LinkedIn may favor one language)
- If user has both en and es configured, aim for a balanced mix across the week
- Return slots with language field populated
- POST-07: Language choice per post. POST-08: When language is "both", the /psn:plan command will instruct Claude to generate two independent versions (not translations).

**src/planning/recycling.ts:**
- `getRemixSuggestions(db, userId, limit = 3)` (CONTENT-03): Query top-performing posts (by engagementScore) from the last 90 days. For each, suggest adapting to a different platform. E.g., a high-performing X thread could become a LinkedIn carousel. Return: { originalPostId, originalPlatform, suggestedPlatform, topic, suggestedFormat }[]
- `getRecycleSuggestions(db, userId, limit = 3)` (CONTENT-04): Query top performers older than 60 days. Suggest posting the same core idea with a fresh angle. Return: { originalPostId, topic, originalAngle, suggestedAngle, daysSincePublished }[]

**src/cli/plan.ts:**
Follow established CLI pattern:
- Export functions + import.meta.main entry point
- Subcommands:
  - `calendar` -- runs getCalendarState for current week, outputs JSON
  - `ideate` -- runs generatePlanIdeas, outputs JSON array of 10-15 PlanIdeas
  - `rate <ideaId> <rating>` -- rating is "love" | "maybe" | "kill". Love: transition idea to ready. Maybe: transition to seed. Kill: transition to killed with reason prompt. (PLAN-05)
  - `slot` -- runs allocateSlots with current state, outputs JSON plan
  - `languages` -- runs suggestLanguages on current plan, outputs updated plan
  - `remix` -- runs getRemixSuggestions, outputs JSON
  - `recycle` -- runs getRecycleSuggestions, outputs JSON
  - `save <planJson>` -- inserts/updates weekly_plans table with the plan
  - `status` -- shows current plan state (if one exists for this week)
- All output JSON to stdout

**Wire src/content/topic-suggest.ts:**
- The existing `checkIdeaBank()` is a stub returning empty array. Replace it with a real implementation:
  - Import getReadyIdeas from src/ideas/bank.ts
  - Accept db and userId parameters (add to function signature)
  - Query ready ideas and return them as TopicSuggestion[] format
  - Keep backward compatibility: if no db provided, return empty array (fallback for non-DB contexts)

**.claude/commands/psn/plan.md:**
Multi-phase slash command following RESEARCH.md Pattern 3. Instruct Claude to:

**Phase 1 (Calendar):** Run `bun run src/cli/plan.ts calendar`. Show the user their current week: what's scheduled, what series are due, where the gaps are. Ask if they want to continue to ideation or stop here (PLAN-08).

**Phase 2 (Ideation):** Run `bun run src/cli/plan.ts ideate`. Present 10-15 ideas grouped by source (trending, from bank, generated, remix, recycle). For each, show topic, pillar, angle, source. Ask user to rate each: love it / maybe later / kill it (PLAN-05). Run `rate` CLI for each rated idea. Ask if they want to continue to slot allocation or stop here.

**Phase 3 (Slot Allocation):** Run `bun run src/cli/plan.ts slot`. Show the proposed week calendar with:
- Series episodes locked in first
- Pillar distribution noted
- Language suggestions per slot
- Format variety shown
Let user swap, reorder, or remove slots. Ask if they want to continue to drafting or stop here.

**Phase 4 (Drafting):** For each slot marked for drafting, use the existing /psn:post workflow to generate content. Generate 2-3 key drafts (per CONTEXT.md: "hybrid: calendar outline + key drafts"). Remaining slots stay as outlines for later `/psn:post` calls.

**Phase 5 (Scheduling):** For approved/finished drafts, schedule via Trigger.dev delayed runs (existing publish-post flow). Save the final plan to DB via `save` CLI subcommand.

For bilingual "both" slots (POST-08): instruct Claude to generate two independent versions using language-specific voice context. NOT a translation -- two separate generation passes. Suggest approach per CONTEXT.md: two separate posts (X, TikTok) or one combined (LinkedIn). User confirms.

For ANLYT-10: when creating posts, include the `language` field in the post record so analytics can track per-language performance.

**POST-07 + POST-08: Update .claude/commands/psn/post.md with language selection step:**

After step 3 (Persona selection) and before step 4 (Topic gathering), add a new step "3b. Language selection":
- Check the user's voice profile for defaultLanguage setting
- If profile has bilingual configured (defaultLanguage: "both" or languages section has both en and es):
  - Ask user: "What language for this post? (en / es / both)"
  - If "both": Suggest approach based on platform:
    - X, TikTok: "I'll create two separate posts -- one in English, one in Spanish"
    - LinkedIn: "Want two separate posts or one combined post with both languages?"
  - User confirms approach
- If profile is monolingual: use default language silently, skip prompt
- Pass the selected language to all subsequent steps (generate, save draft, schedule)

**SERIES-03: Update /psn:post topic-gathering step (step 4):**

Before checking the idea bank or generating suggestions, add a due-series check:
```
bun run src/cli/series.ts due
```
- If due episodes exist: Present them first with series name, episode label, and format template
  - "You have a series episode due: [Series Name] #[Episode]. Want to create this episode?"
  - If user picks a series episode: use the series template, pillar, and format for generation. Pass seriesId to the draft.
  - If user declines: proceed to normal idea bank / topic suggestion flow
- If no due episodes: proceed silently to existing flow

**POST-08: Update src/content/generate.ts to support language "both":**

Modify `GeneratePostOptions.language` type from `"en" | "es"` to `"en" | "es" | "both"`.

When language is "both" in `generatePost()`:
- Do NOT generate a single bilingual draft
- Instead, run two sequential generation passes:
  1. First pass: call the existing generation logic with language="en", save draft with language="en"
  2. Second pass: call the existing generation logic with language="es", save draft with language="es"
- Each pass uses language-specific voice context from buildVoicePromptContext
- Return a modified GeneratedDraft that includes a `bilingualPair` field: `{ en: GeneratedDraft, es: GeneratedDraft }` so the slash command can present both to the user
- Add `bilingualPair?: { en: GeneratedDraft; es: GeneratedDraft }` to the GeneratedDraft interface

This ensures bilingual posts are independently crafted (per user decision in CONTEXT.md), not translations.

**SERIES-03: Wire recordEpisodePublished into src/trigger/publish-post.ts:**

After a post successfully transitions to status=published (the existing publish success path), add a series state advancement check:
- Import `recordEpisodePublished` from `src/series/episodes.ts`
- After the publish succeeds, read `post.seriesId` from the post record
- If `post.seriesId` is non-null: call `await recordEpisodePublished(db, post.seriesId)`
- This updates the series row's `episodeCount` and `lastPublishedAt` so that `getDueEpisodes` and `getNextEpisodeLabel` reflect the real publish history
- Wrap in try/catch: a failure to advance series state must NOT roll back the publish itself. Log the error but allow the publish job to complete successfully.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `bun run check` to confirm generate.ts and publish-post.ts compile with the new types and imports.
Grep for "Language selection" or "language" in .claude/commands/psn/post.md to confirm the step exists.
