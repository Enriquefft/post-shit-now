<objective>
Build the idea bank: type definitions, capture with inline tag parsing, maturity pipeline state machine, staleness/expiry management, querying, and the /psn:capture slash command.

Purpose: Ideas are the raw material for weekly planning. Without an idea bank, the system has no memory of content opportunities between sessions.
Output: Complete src/ideas/ directory with types, capture, lifecycle, and bank modules. CLI script and slash command for /psn:capture.
</objective>

**src/ideas/types.ts:**
- `IdeaStatus` type: "spark" | "seed" | "ready" | "claimed" | "developed" | "used" | "killed"
- `Urgency` type: "timely" | "seasonal" | "evergreen"
- `IdeaSourceType` type: "trend" | "capture" | "plan" | "remix" | "recycle"
- `Idea` interface matching the ideas table schema from schema.ts
- `CaptureInput` interface: { text, tags?, urgency?, hub?, pillar?, platform?, format? }
- `VALID_TRANSITIONS` constant: Record<IdeaStatus, IdeaStatus[]> as defined in RESEARCH.md:
  - spark: [seed, killed]
  - seed: [ready, killed, spark]
  - ready: [claimed, killed, seed]
  - claimed: [developed, ready]
  - developed: [used, killed, claimed]
  - used: [] (terminal)
  - killed: [spark] (can resurrect)
- `STALENESS_DAYS` constant: { spark: 14, seed: 30 } (per RESEARCH.md recommendation)

**src/ideas/capture.ts:**
- `parseInlineTags(input: string)`: Extract #key:value tags from input text. Returns { text: string (cleaned), tags: Record<string, string> }. Pattern: `/#(\w+):(\S+)/g`. Recognized tag keys: pillar, platform, format, urgency, hub.
- `captureIdea(db, userId, input: CaptureInput)`: Insert into ideas table. If urgency is "timely" and no expiresAt, set expiresAt to 48 hours from now. If urgency is "seasonal" and no expiresAt, set expiresAt to 30 days. Map parsed tags to the appropriate columns (pillar, platform, format). Set sourceType to "capture". Returns the created idea with its id.
- `inferUrgency(text: string)`: Simple heuristic -- if text contains time-sensitive keywords ("breaking", "just announced", "today", "this week", "trending now"), return "timely". If contains seasonal terms ("holiday", "new year", "black friday", "q4"), return "seasonal". Otherwise "evergreen". Used when urgency is not explicitly provided.

**src/ideas/lifecycle.ts:**
- `transitionIdea(db, ideaId, newStatus, opts?: { claimedBy?, killReason? })`: Validates transition against VALID_TRANSITIONS. If invalid, throws error with current + attempted status. Updates status, lastTouchedAt. If newStatus === "claimed", set claimedBy. If newStatus === "killed", set killReason (required). Returns updated idea.
- `autoPromoteIdeas(db, userId)`: Queries spark ideas that have matching trends (by title keyword overlap against trends table where overallScore > 50). Promotes matching sparks to seed. Also promotes seeds that have notes added (notes is not null) to ready. Returns count of promoted ideas. Per user decision: auto-promote with override.
- `getStaleIdeas(db, userId)`: Queries ideas where status is spark and lastTouchedAt is older than STALENESS_DAYS.spark, or status is seed and lastTouchedAt is older than STALENESS_DAYS.seed. Returns stale ideas for user review.
- `expireTimelyIdeas(db, userId)`: Queries timely ideas where expiresAt is in the past and status is not used/killed. Sets status to "killed" with killReason "expired (timely)". Returns count of expired ideas.
- `recordKillFeedback(db, ideaId, killReason: string)`: Updates kill_reason on the idea. This data can be queried by the preference model to understand what types of ideas the user rejects.

  <verify>Run `bun run check` to confirm all files compile. Grep for VALID_TRANSITIONS, captureIdea, transitionIdea, autoPromoteIdeas exports.</verify>
  <done>Idea types defined, capture function parses inline tags and inserts to DB, lifecycle state machine validates all transitions, staleness/expiry detection works.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Create idea bank queries, capture CLI, and /psn:capture slash command</name>
  <files>
    src/ideas/bank.ts
    src/cli/capture.ts
    .claude/commands/psn/capture.md
  </files>
  <action>
**src/ideas/bank.ts:**
- `getReadyIdeas(db, userId, opts?: { pillar?, platform?, limit? })`: Query ideas with status "ready", ordered by lastTouchedAt desc. Filter by pillar/platform if provided. Default limit 10.
- `searchIdeas(db, userId, query: string, opts?: { status?, limit? })`: Search ideas by ILIKE on title and notes columns. Optional status filter. Default limit 20.
- `getIdeasByStatus(db, userId, status: IdeaStatus, opts?: { limit? })`: Simple status filter query.
- `getIdeaStats(db, userId)`: Returns count by status: { spark: N, seed: N, ready: N, claimed: N, developed: N, used: N, killed: N }.
- `listIdeas(db, userId, opts?: { status?, urgency?, pillar?, limit?, offset? })`: General-purpose list with optional filters and pagination. Returns ideas ordered by createdAt desc.

**src/cli/capture.ts:**
Follow the established CLI pattern from src/cli/post.ts:
- Export functions for import AND have import.meta.main entry point
- Accept argv: `capture "idea text with #tags"`, `list [--status=ready] [--pillar=ai]`, `stats`, `stale`, `expire`
- `capture` subcommand: Parse inline tags from text, call captureIdea, output JSON with created idea
- `list` subcommand: Call listIdeas with parsed filters, output JSON array
- `stats` subcommand: Call getIdeaStats, output JSON
- `stale` subcommand: Call getStaleIdeas, output JSON array
- `expire` subcommand: Call expireTimelyIdeas, output JSON with count
- All output to stdout as JSON (Claude interprets it per established pattern)
- Load DATABASE_URL from config/hub.env via loadEnvFile

**.claude/commands/psn/capture.md:**
Slash command that instructs Claude to:
1. Accept user's idea (any format: sentence, URL, screenshot description, raw thought)
2. Run the capture CLI: `bun run src/cli/capture.ts capture "user's idea text #optional:tags"`
3. Parse the JSON output and confirm the idea was captured
4. Show the idea's status, urgency, and any inferred tags
5. Ask if the user wants to add notes, change urgency, or capture another
6. For `list` mode: run `bun run src/cli/capture.ts list` and present ideas in a readable format
7. For `stale` mode: show stale ideas and ask user to keep or kill each one

The slash command should be concise and fast -- the goal is under 30 seconds for a basic capture (IDEA-01).
  </action>
  <verify>Run `bun run check` to confirm all files compile. Verify .claude/commands/psn/capture.md exists. Grep for getReadyIdeas, listIdeas exports in bank.ts.</verify>
  <done>Idea bank queries work for ready ideas, search, filtering. CLI supports capture/list/stats/stale/expire subcommands. /psn:capture slash command enables fast idea capture.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `bun run check` passes
- src/ideas/ directory has types.ts, capture.ts, lifecycle.ts, bank.ts
- src/cli/capture.ts has import.meta.main entry point
- .claude/commands/psn/capture.md exists
- State machine prevents invalid transitions (e.g., spark -> developed should fail)
- Inline tag parsing extracts #pillar:ai #format:thread correctly
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Complete idea bank system where ideas can be captured with inline tags, flow through the maturity pipeline, get staleness warnings, and expire when timely. CLI and slash command provide fast capture UX.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-intelligence-ideation-and-planning/05-03-SUMMARY.md`
