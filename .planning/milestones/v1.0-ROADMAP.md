**Archived:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** Complete
**Total Requirements:** 148
**Completed:** 148/148 (100%)

## Overview

Post Shit Now delivers a Claude Code-first social media growth system in 14 phases. Phase 1 lays infrastructure (hub architecture, DB, migrations). Phase 2 adds OAuth and the X posting pipeline. Phase 3 builds voice profiling and content generation — the core differentiator. Phase 4 adds analytics and the learning loop that makes content improve over time. Phase 5 brings intelligence gathering, idea management, weekly planning, content series, and bilingual support. Phase 6 extends to LinkedIn with multi-platform adaptation. Phase 7 adds Company Hubs, team coordination, approval workflows, and WhatsApp notifications. Phase 8 completes platform coverage with Instagram, TikTok, and the engagement engine. Phase 13 adds academic content support for researchers. Phases 14a-c close v1.0 milestone gaps for full completion.
