## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 108 requirements; comprehensive depth
- [Roadmap]: Submit LinkedIn partner API + TikTok audit applications in Phase 1 (multi-week lead times)
- [Roadmap]: X is first platform (easiest API access, no approval gates)
- [Roadmap]: Voice profiling is Phase 3 (core differentiator, needs infrastructure first)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- LinkedIn partner API approval takes 2-6 weeks — must submit in Phase 1, needed by Phase 6
- TikTok audit takes 1-2 weeks — must submit in Phase 1, needed by Phase 8
- drizzle-kit push silently deletes RLS policies — only generate+migrate is safe (Phase 1 must establish this)
- OAuth token refresh race conditions must be solved with row-level locking before any task automation (Phase 2)
